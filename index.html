        <h2>Why this project?</h2>
        <p>I remember that when I was a kid and a teenager, the game Flappy Bird had just come out and it was very popular. Every child had a phone in their hand, playing it even in class. At that time, 
            I didn’t have a phone, so I could only watch other teenagers play. Many years later, while I was working with Python, I remembered this memory and thought, "Why don’t I create my own Flappy Bird 
            as a small project to learn more about Python?"
        </p>

        <h2>How to make this flappybird project</h2>

        <p> First of all, I started by checking the easiest way to make this game. I knew about coding, 
            but I had never worked with a screen where I could actually play. I had only been working in VS Code 
            and testing my code. Then I realized that using the Pygame library would make it much easier to create
            this game because the library is designed for this kind of project. It helped me a lot.  Next, I needed to
            find some pictures from the internet that I could use in my game. I found a background image, a ground image,
            bird images, pipe images, and a nice restart button image. After that, I started coding my project. I struggled 
            a lot because it was my first time working with the Pygame library. I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiUGVOqqCKg&list=PLjcN1EyupaQkz5Olxzwvo1OzDNaNLGWoJ" > YouTube series </a> that showed exactly 
            how to code a Flappy Bird game and explained every single line. It was extremely helpful for me to create my project.
