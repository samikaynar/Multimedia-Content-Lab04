        <h2>Why is this project</h2>
        <p>I remember that when I was a kid , teeneger , flappybird game just came out and it was so famous game to play 
            every child has phone on their hand and playing this game even in the class . In this time i didint have any 
            phone to play and i was only wathcing these teenagers while they play. After many years i was working on python 
            programing language , i remembered this memory and i was like why i dont create my own flappybird as a small project 
            to learn more about python .
        </p>

        <h2>How to make this flappybird project</h2>

        <p> First of all, I started by checking the easiest way to make this game. I knew about coding, 
            but I had never worked with a screen where I could actually play. I had only been working in VS Code 
            and testing my code. Then I realized that using the Pygame library would make it much easier to create
            this game because the library is designed for this kind of project. It helped me a lot.  Next, I needed to
            find some pictures from the internet that I could use in my game. I found a background image, a ground image,
            bird images, pipe images, and a nice restart button image. After that, I started coding my project. I struggled 
            a lot because it was my first time working with the Pygame library. I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiUGVOqqCKg&list=PLjcN1EyupaQkz5Olxzwvo1OzDNaNLGWoJ" > YouTube series </a> that showed exactly 
            how to code a Flappy Bird game and explained every single line. It was extremely helpful for me to create my project.
